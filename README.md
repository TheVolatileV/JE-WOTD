## User Instructions

Navigate to [https://jewotd-spa.herokuapp.com/](https://jewotd-spa.herokuapp.com/)

Should you choose to register for the daily email please use the text box at the top of the page.

### Should I run the API or email_wkr locally?

As these services uses many components and many other services it is not intended to be run locally without assistance from myself. This is because you would need to be added to my AWS account as well as given access to several other services in order for the backbone of this project to function on your local machine.

### Running the SPA locally

To run the spa locally all you need is to install [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/). After downloading and pulling the project from Github you will need to run `npm install` and `npm run dev` after navigating into the `spa/jewotd-spa` directory.
